I am currently a postdoc at Radboud University, Nijmegen under the supervision of [Magdalena Kędziorek](https://sites.google.com/view/mkedziorek). My research interest lies in motivic, and equivariant stable homotopy theory. I have finished my PhD under careful supervision of [Oliver Röndigs](http://mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de/roendigs).

In motivic homotopy theory, I am interested in the notion of different orientations of cohomology theories of varieties, and different algebraic cobordisms arising from these notions. I like to try to compute stable homotopy groups of these theories.

Recently I got interested in understanding different levels of equivariant commutativity (aka normed infinity operads) in the rational setting.

Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C4sI0T-GbJDAUczOHw2nza_h3yVMUvo0/view?usp=sharing).
